# ICP
#This is my final year project
The objective of this project is to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create an Integrated Care Portal using Java, Java Swing, SQLite, and Eclipse IDE.T

You will have a clear understanding of how to create a system with the ability to manage patient data, appointments, prescriptions, medications, doctors, and more. Additionally, we will learn how to implement features such as input panels, tables, and database management.


Steps to Create Integrated Care Portal using Java
Following are the steps for developing the Java Integrated Care Portal project:

Step 1: Setting Up the Project and Classes in Eclipse
Launch Eclipse and go to “File” > “New” > “Java Project”.
Give the project a name, such as “Hospital Management System”.
Right-click on the project and select “New” > “Class”.
Name the first class, for example, “Integrated Care Portal”.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create another class, such as “Database”.

Step 2: Adding SQLite to the Project in Eclipse
Go to the Project Explorer in Eclipse and right-click on your project.
Select “Properties” from the menu.
In the Properties window, navigate to “Java Build Path” and click the “Libraries” tab.
Click the “Add External JARs” button and find the SQLite JAR file.
Choose the JAR file and press “Open”.
Click “OK” to close the Properties window.
Note: Before moving forward, make sure to have the SQLite JAR file downloaded and saved on your computer. This file can be found on MavenRepository if needed. Incorporating SQLite into your Eclipse project is now complete after following the steps outlined above.

Step 3: Implementing the Database class

Step 4: Implementing the ICP class

Step 5: Run on eclipse now and see the output
